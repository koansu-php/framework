# Koansu

Koansu - from the japanese word kōan suru: 考案: to design, to invent; to devise, to develop, to think up

## Why another framework

Koansu is a framework for professional php developers. It bypasses all the "simplifying" inconsistencies of php to enforce devs to work more strict to coding principles and avoid the susceptibility of php application for maintenance issues, security vulnerablities and performance regressions.

It is strongly inspired by the Zen of python, SOLID, DDD, Laravel, The Qt Framework and Flask.
